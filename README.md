# BeagoAI Unofficial API

# Description

**BeagoAI Unofficial API** is a Python client library designed to interact with the Beago AI platform unofficially. It provides a simple interface to authenticate and communicate with the Beago AI API, allowing users to send queries and receive responses in a structured format. This library is intended for educational purposes and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Beago AI.

## How It Works

The library handles authentication by using API keys and refresh tokens stored in a `.env` file. It retrieves and stores tokens securely, allowing users to interact with the Beago AI API seamlessly. The `chat` method sends user queries to the API and processes the responses, which may include text, images, and quotes.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Automatically handles token retrieval and storage.
- **Query Processing**: Sends user queries to the Beago AI API and processes the responses.
- **Response Handling**: Supports streaming responses, including text, images, and quotes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/beagoai-unofficial-api.git
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API credentials:
   ```
   KEY=your_api_key
   REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
   ```

## Usage
```python
  from BeagoAI import BeagoAI_Unofficial
  # Initialize the client
  beago_ai = BeagoAI_Unofficial()
  # Send a query
  response = beago_ai.chat("Hello, Beago AI!")
  print(response)
```

## Notes
- Ensure your KEY and REFRESH_TOKEN is valid to avoid authentication errors.
- API response time depends on your network speed and server availability.
